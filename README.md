This code started out as richardhills/ol-react for ol3
and brian32768 rewrote it for ol6

This version is written for OpenLayers 6 (which has been released!! 2019-Sep-26)

## Overview
A wrapper for [OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org/) in [React](https://reactjs.org/).

The goal is to be able to write applications using OpenLayers maps in a declarative way. For example, the following is JSX, which can be returned by the render() method on a React component,
to generate a map with a square near the equator.
```
  <MapProvider map={theMap}>
    <Map>
        <CollectionProvider collection={mapLayers}>
          <layer.Tile>
            <source.OSM />
          </layer.Tile>
          <layer.Vector>
            <source.Vector>
              <Feature>
                <geom.LineString>
                  {[[0, 0], [100000, 0], [100000, 100000], [0, 100000]]}
                </geom.LineString>
              </Feature>
            </source.Vector>
          </layer.Vector>
        </CollectionProvider>
    </Map>
  </MapProvider>
```
To understand what each element does, read the [OpenLayers API documentation](http://openlayers.org/en/latest/apidoc/).

I experimented for months with making the source a property of the layer component and just
went back! So I don't even have to change the documentation!

### Other similar projects
Someone sent me a link to [allenhkim/react-openlayers](https://github.com/allenhwkim/react-openlayers), which looks good too. If you know of others let me know.

## Trying it out
The examples at this point rely pretty heavily on data that I host for my own development.
They will still run but there will be layers missing.

Note that OL6 wants you to install pbf, pixelworks, and rbush yourself (via npm).

## Run!

The project uses npm and the parcel bundler. You need to install npm and then
install parcel globally. (``npm install parcel -g``) Once you have done that, use
```
npm start
```
to launch node and open a brower on http://localhost:1234/

```
npm
### Styles

The original richardhills version of ol-react had a way to generate styles in JSX notation
but I decided that it's not worth writing and maintaining extra wrapper code,
so currently I write the styles using JavaScript
and pass an OpenLayers Style object in to ol-react.
It takes about the same amount of code either way.

See examples/example1.js for more code.

#### The current version
Write the JavaScript to generate an OpenLayers Style object then pass the object to a Feature component.

JavaScript style declaration
```
import {Style, Circle, Fill, Stroke} from 'ol/style'
const cStyle = new Style(
    new Circle({ radius: 10,
        fill: new Fill({color: rgba(100,100,100,0.5)}),
        stroke: new Stroke({color: "green"})
    }))
```

JSX snippet using the style
``` JSX
    <Feature id="C2" style={cStyle}>
        <geom.Circle transform={ transformfn } >{[6000,0]}</geom.Circle>
    </Feature>
```

#### Styles the OLD way
This does not work anymore, I am leaving it here in case I resurrect it next week. :-)

Styles used to be declared using a JSON object, passing through the properties you'd like on the final object. For example, when creating a Circle, a `type` parameter must be present,
with the value of `circle`. Like this:

```
image: {
    type: 'circle',
    radius: 10,
    fill: { color: [100,100,100, 0.5] },
    stroke: { color: 'green', width: 1 }
}
```
## API keys

When a map source needs a key you need to put the
key into an environment variable.

* BINGMAPS_KEY (used in example4)
* MAPBOX_KEY (used in example7)
* THUNDERFOREST_KEY (used in exampl5)

I keep my keys in a file called ".env".
The file looks like this (with real keys, of course):

````bash
MAPBOX_KEY="N0SeynB28iOx7U04i7OTz0xPqqgCU3vOs0tcLwws5"
BINGMAPS_KEY="SeynB28iOx7U04i7OTz0xPqqgCU3vOs0tcLww"
THUNDERFOREST_KEY="89ausduhasd898asduyuhadha0s9djd"
````

## Project status

### Testing

I just ran across this article on testing that is very useful. Partly becauase of testing :-)
and partly because it shows me how to solve some little React problems in ways I have not
seen before.

https://medium.com/@compatt84/how-to-test-open-layers-react-components-with-mocha-part-i-9a2ca0458ba1

## How to test and develop

Set up OpenLayers 6 as described above.
For more help see also the react-simplemap repo.

### Test
The command `npm start` will launch the demo setup in a browser. Currently that is where I do my testing.

### Build a package and test it

Do this before sending a new version of the package up to npmjs.com.
It will build the package and then run a simple app that uses the package.
I need to learn how to do real tests...

```
npm run build-package
npm run test
```

### How I publish to npmjs.com

This will publish the contents of the src/ folder as a new release.
To install it for use in your own project, use "npm install @map46/ol-react".

    # Save all changes to github
    git push
    # Move to master branch
    git checkout master
    # Merge changes from development branch
    git merge dev
    git commit -a
    git push

I had to wrestle for an hour before finding I had to do this to make "npm version" work.

    eval $(ssh-agent -s) && ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_github_bwilsoncc

or at home,

    eval $(ssh-agent -s) && ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_github

Update version in package.json (see below)

    npm version minor
    # or
    npm version patch

Get the current version number from the npm version command and use it here, without the leading 'v'.

    npm login
    tasks/publish.sh 0.2.18
    git checkout master

Do NOT run "npm publish" yourself in the top level folder. It will publish too much!
The publish script will run "npm build-package" and "npm publish" for you.
The script runs 'npm publish' after chdir'ing down into the build folder.

At this point do 'git status' and you will see you're not on a branch.
You need to do a 'git checkout master' to move back onto that branch or 'git checkout dev' to go back to work.

### Update git

When I do significant changes I bump the patch version number or possibly the minor version

The "npm version" command fails if changes are left uncommitted, so 'git commit' first.

If the current version in package.json is 0.1.9 then
````npm version patch```` would bump the third digit (eg 0.1.10)
and
````npm version minor```` would bump the second digit (eg 0.2.0)
and in either case, it's all pushed up to github.

### Deploy

Install in your project with ````npm install @map46/ol-react````.

## The cry for help

If you're familiar with React and/or OpenLayers and are interested in helping, please get in touch.

The original OL3 version available on [github](https://github.com/richardhills/ol-react) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ol-react).
my fork at [github](https://github.com/wildsong/ol-react)

Richard says he is "especially interested in assistance with having each component be optionally [controlled](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/forms.html#controlled-components). This would allow binding of the components with, say, Redux and for sophisticated state management outside of OpenLayers."

Brian says "Every day is like Monday to me at this stage."
